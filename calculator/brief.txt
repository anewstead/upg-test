Write and host a single web-page that should run on a smart phone,implementing (in front-end javascript, not server-side) a basic calculatorfunction. This does not need to be beautiful, but must support at least thefollowing operations:      +  -  *  /   %  ^   SQRT.[By % and ^, I mean "modulo" and "to the power of"]It must detect and notify of illegal input (e.g. sqrt(-1)).Serve it up over https.[Hint: letsencypt is a easy way to do the https part; the javascript should beless than 100 lines, and not rely upon external frameworks or libraries]
