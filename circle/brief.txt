12. Given an array of n points (x,y) in the 2D cartesian plane, write a shortfunction to find the smallest possible circle that encloses them all.Specify that circle as (x,y,r), i.e. center co-ordinates and radius.[You can treat a point that touches the circle as being "within" it. You shouldalso explain the algorithm you use; a perfect solution to this problem is non-trivial.Since this is a test of programming, rather than mathematics, it is more importantthat the code  you write corresponds to the algorithm you document, than that thealgorithm itself is optimal.]-----this version does not entirely work:
 - the enclosing circle does not touch minimum 2 dots
 - this is because iâ€™m using a bounding square to find the centre of cluster
